## Overview of the Project:
Our team is looking to build a bike-share company in Des Moines, Iowa. We gained our inspiration from the company Citi Bike in New York. We have gotten an angel investor and have analyzed bike-sharing data from New York to create our proposal for how this opportunity could work in Des Moines, Iowa.
## Overview of the Analysis: 
The bike-sharing analysis will provide insights into overall utilization, number of trips, and popular starting and ending locations. These results will give guidance for creating a bike-sharing company in another large city, like Des Moines.
## Results: 
#### Number of Trips
The most popular trip start and stop times are between 8 am - 9 am and 5 pm - 6 pm. The most popular days are Monday through Friday, with Saturday and Sunday having spikes between 10 am and 6 pm.
#### Popular Check out Times
The most popular checkout time is 5 minutes, with 146,752 bikes checked out. Bike check-outs plateau after 60 minutes, with more than 200 bikes checked out.
#### Trips by Gender
Overall, males are utilizing the bikes are more than females. There are significantly more males using the subscription option, with a peak of 259,316 trips on Thursday.
#### Trip Locations
The most popular starting and stopping locations are located within Midtown Manhattan to lower Manhattan. There is a spike near and south of Central Park.
## Summary: 
Overall, the bike-sharing company is utilized by roughly 260,000 users per day. The bikes are used the most during commuting hours and in the heart of the city. 

However, for further investigation, it would be helpful to account for the population size of New York City. 8.4 million people were living in New York City when the data was collected.  Therefore, 3% of the population used the bike-sharing program per day. This information will help scale the bike company to fit the population size of Des Moines. 

Additionally, it would be helpful to overlay the stop and start locations with the public transit systems. This would be helpful to know if individuals are more likely to take a bike when it's near the bus stops or if they are more likely when the bus stops are more than four blocks away.
